# Fair Use Natural Language Processing 

This repository contains materials for a project regarding how the judiciary delineates the fair use doctrine. 

## Introduction

The Fair Use defense is on the rise. With the rise of AI technologies, there is a goal for understanding the major defense used in such cases, namely the fair use doctrine. Often tasked with deciding whether the infringment occurred on the basis of whether the target work is sufficiently transformative from its source, recent discussions of the jurisprudence base itself on intuition, specifically that judges and juries are asked to judge the degree of similarity between the two works such that it is so striking or substantial that the similarity could only have been caused by copying. Whether this leads to consistent outcomes for finding fair use is unclear. 

Deriving our work from the [USCO Fair Use Database](https://www.copyright.gov/fair-use/fair-index.html), we compiled the data from the fair use doctrine.
